As the survey and data manager for the Proyecto Dengue Program Project Grant (P01, PIs Dr. Tom Scott and Dr. Amy Morrison), I developed and managed surveys and data-collection efforts for a longitudinal cohort study with over **15,000 participants** under surveillance for dengue and Zika virus infections in Iquitos, Peru. My main duties were programming the CommCare mobile application system used to administer surveys in the field, designing surveys, translating and streamlining surveys and standard operating procedures into Spanish, field-testing applications and survey protocols in Iquitos, and administering trainings in Spanish on using the CommCare data collection application and data management to Peruvian doctors and field technicians in Iquitos. To to ensure that the surveys and mobile application system were user-friendly for the field-technicians while also maintained the integrity of the data, I served as a liaison between and communicated heavily with field technicians, project managers, the CommCare database management team, and project scientists. Additionally, I developed an extensive knowledge of dengue and Zika epidemiology and a strong understanding of the socio-demographic determinants of both diseases.
