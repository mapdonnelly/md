As the survey and data manager for the Proyecto Dengue Program Project Grant (P01, PIs Dr. Tom Scott and Dr. Amy Morrison), I developed and managed surveys and data-collection efforts for a longitudinal cohort study with over **15,000** participants under surveillance for dengue and Zika virus infections in Iquitos, Peru. I independently programmed the a mobile application (CommCare) system used to administer field surveys, designed surveys, translated and streamlined surveys and standard operating procedures into Spanish, field-tested applications and survey protocols, and administered trainings to Peruvian doctors and field technicians -- all in Spanish -- on using the CommCare data collection application. I designed the surveys and mobile application to be user-friendly for field technicians and maintained data quality control. I also served as a liaison between field technicians, project managers, the CommCare database management team, and project scientists. Throughout the process, I developed an extensive knowledge of dengue and Zika epidemiology and a strong understanding of the socio-demographic determinants of both diseases.
